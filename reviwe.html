              I have to commute a lot to attend classes at Coding Elements. I don't mind. Because
              every single class has been worth the tiresome journey. So, you asked for the reviews
              for Coding Elements. And I had a lot to say. I wanted it to be a tad personal, but not
              too much. Hence this piece.

              all the conversations we have had apart from 'Python', they were very meaningful in itself.<br>
              And you shared freely, everything that you could, about computing and other topics, and  I think, this too,
              will help me cast my career in a different light. In recent days, you have become a friend,
              a teacher and a mentor. And writing this was my way of saying 'Thank You'.

              I think, you are one of the best teachers I've had. Probably the best. I don't know. <br>
              I don't like to judge, but I hold you in quite high an Esteem. I think you are really good <br>
              at teaching the things you teach, but you are also good at listening to the doubts and <br>
              getting to the core of issues, and understanding what is really bothersome.

              Prior to embarking on the study trip to India, I did countless hours of research and <br>
              eventually decided to enroll in the Python and Machine learning course at Coding Elements. <br>
              Mr. Mudit has been one of the best teachers I have learnt from in my entire education timeline.

              Also, the non-judgmental approach you take towards us, that's quite a relief in itself. <br>
              It's a lot of pressure off the back of any student who is trying to master a new skill. <br>
              I am hyperactive and it is really hard for me to keep my interest at one place for months on end.
